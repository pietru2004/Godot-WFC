# Main Screen Plugin Demo

This plugin demo shows how to make a main screen plugin.
The main screen appears as a button next to the "2D", "3D", "Script", and
"AssetLib" buttons. It also shows up when a Node it `handles` is selected.

For more information, see this documentation article:

If you would like to see a more complete example of what main screen plugins
are capable of, check out the [2.5D demo project](../../../misc/2.5d).
